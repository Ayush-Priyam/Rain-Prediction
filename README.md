# Rain Prediction Project

### Built a classifier to predict whether there will be rain the following day or not.

Used a rainfall dataset from Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology, cleaned the data, and applied different classification algorithm on the data.
Used classification algorithms to create a model based on the training data and evaluated the testing data using various evaluation metrics.

Used these algorithms:

1.  Linear Regression
2.  KNN
3.  Decision Trees
4.  Logistic Regression
5.  SVM

Evaluated the models using:

1.  Accuracy Score
2.  Jaccard Index
3.  F1-Score
4.  LogLoss
5.  Mean Absolute Error
6.  Mean Squared Error
7.  R2-Score
